To copy data from your laptop to a DVD using your DVD drive, follow these steps based on your operating system:

✅ Requirements
A laptop with a DVD writer.

A blank writable DVD (DVD-R or DVD+R for one-time write, or DVD-RW/DVD+RW for rewritable).

Files or folders to burn.

(Optional) A burning software if you're not using built-in tools.

💻 For Windows 10/11
🔹 Step 1: Insert the Blank DVD
Insert a blank DVD into your laptop’s DVD drive.

Windows will detect it and show a prompt:
👉 “What do you want to do with this disc?”

🔹 Step 2: Choose Burn Option
Choose "Burn files to disc".

Give your disc a name.

Choose between:

Like a USB flash drive (lets you drag/drop, rewritable style).

With a CD/DVD player (finalizes and makes compatible with other DVD players).

🔹 Step 3: Add Files
Drag and drop the files/folders into the DVD window.

🔹 Step 4: Burn the Disc
Click on the "Drive Tools" tab (top menu).

Click "Finish burning" or "Burn to disc".

Follow the wizard and wait for the process to complete.
